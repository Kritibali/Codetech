<h2>Introduction :</h2>
<p>Python is a simple, general purpose, high level, and object-oriented programming language.
Python is an interpreted scripting language also. <strong>Guido Van Rossum</strong> is known as the founder of Python programming.

	<h4>Fact #1</h4>
	<p>The name of this language was derived from the British comedy series<em> Monty Python's Flying Circus.</em> The comedy was aired on BBC during the 1970s and it gave the creator some form of entertainment during the language development. Also, Van Rossum wanted a name that was short, and mysterious. Something that will capture everyoneï¿½s attention.</p>

	<div class="sideleft">
	<h4>Fact #2</h4>
	<p>As a high-level and interpreted language, Python does not need a compiler. This is unlike Java and C++ which have to be compiled first before being interpreted. For Python, it relies on an application known as an interpreter.</p>

		<h4>Fact #3</h4>
		<p>Do you know that Python is one of the official programming languages that are used at Google? <em><strong>Google Search </strong></em>and <em><strong>YouTube </strong></em> are just some of the products that are powered by Python.</p>

<h2>Some Features :</h2>
<ul>
<li>Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high level, and interpreted programming language. It supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.</li>
<br><li>Python's syntax and dynamic typing with its interpreted nature make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development.</li>
<br><li>Python supports multiple programming pattern, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional or procedural programming styles.</li>
<br><li>Python is not intended to work in a particular area, such as web programming. That is why it is known as multipurpose programming language because it can be used with web, enterprise, 3D CAD, etc.</li>
<br><li>We don't need to use data types to declare variable because it is dynamically typed so we can write a=10 to assign an integer value in an integer variable.</li>
<br><li>Python makes the development and debugging fast because there is no compilation step included in Python development, and edit-test-debug cycle is very fast.</li>
</ul><br><hr><br>
<h2>Applications :</h2>
<p>Here, we are specifing applications areas where python can be applied.</p>
<ul>
<br><li>We can use Python to develop web applications. It provides libraries to handle internet protocols such as HTML and XML, JSON, Email processing, request, beautifulSoup, Feedparser etc. It also provides Frameworks such as Django, Pyramid, Flask etc</li>
<br><li>Python is helpful for software development process. It works as a support language and can be used for build control and management, testing etc.</li>
<br><li>Python is used to build Bussiness applications like ERP and e-commerce systems. Tryton is a high level application platform.</li>
<br><li>To create CAD application Fandango is a real application which provides full features of CAD.</li>
<br><li>To create CAD application Fandango is a real application which provides full features of CAD.</li>
<br><li>Python is popular and widely used in scientific and numeric computing. Some useful library and package are SciPy, Pandas, IPython etc. SciPy is group of packages of engineering, science and mathematics.</li>
<br><li>Using Python several application can be developed for image. Applications developed are: VPython, Gogh, imgSeek etc.</li>
</ul>
